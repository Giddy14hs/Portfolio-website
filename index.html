            <p>
              Here at Brighter world, we know Gideon as a hardworking person. The first day he took his role in our organisation, we have witnessed a lot of growth. He has been doing his work with a lot of passion. We tasked him with developing our official website, and within a period of three weeks, Gideon was done with the task. For the period i have interacted with him, I have known him as a person who listens to advices, follows instructions well and always ready to learn. I can't deny that I am always impressed by his work ethics, and most importantly, how he does his work with a lot of passion and dedication
